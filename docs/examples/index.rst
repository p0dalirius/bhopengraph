Examples
========

This section contains various examples demonstrating how to use bhopengraph for different scenarios.

Basic Examples
-------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   simple_path_finding
   node_types_and_properties
   edge_operations
   graph_analysis

Advanced Examples
----------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   advanced_features
   minimal_working_json

Running Examples
---------------

All examples can be run directly from the command line. Make sure you have bhopengraph installed first:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Navigate to the examples directory
   cd examples

   # Run a specific example
   python 01_simple_path_finding.py
   python 02_node_types_and_properties.py
   python 03_edge_operations.py
   python 04_graph_analysis.py
   python advanced_features.py
   python minimal_working_json.py

Example Outputs
--------------

Each example generates output files that demonstrate the functionality:

* **01_simple_path_finding.py**: Creates a simple graph with path finding
* **02_node_types_and_properties.py**: Shows different node types and properties
* **03_edge_operations.py**: Demonstrates edge creation and manipulation
* **04_graph_analysis.py**: Performs basic graph analysis operations
* **advanced_features.py**: Shows advanced features and techniques
* **minimal_working_json.py**: Creates the minimal working JSON example

These examples follow the BloodHound OpenGraph schema and best practices, making them suitable for learning and as templates for your own projects.
